fail2ban v1.1.0
Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS x86_64
```

## 1. Overview
If you maintain your own server, you may be under brute-force attack by bots. As shown in my terminal output, hackers attempt to gain authentication through SSH every second.

*Number of attempts by hackers to access SSH per IP*

**Setting SSH pubkey is the best option** but I sometimes use other computers and other IPs to access remote servers through password authentication. However, since password authentication is weaker than public key authentication, **I tried to find a way to enhance SSH security**.

There are two main ways to prevent SSH hacking attempts. One is using a **Firewall (including Web Application Firewall)** and the other is using **programs designed to prevent hacking**. In this post, I will introduce [fail2ban](https://github.com/fail2ban/fail2ban/wiki), an intrusion prevention software that you can easily install and set up.

## 2. Commands

### 2.1. install
```bash
sudo apt update 
sudo apt install fail2ban
```

### 2.2. Run
If the SSH server access fails multiple times, **fail2ban will ban the IP address that attempted the access**.
```bash
sudo systemctl enable fail2ban # start automatically when boot
sudo systemctl start fail2ban
```

### 2.3. Verify banned ips
```bash
sudo fail2ban-client status sshd
```

*Banned Ips by fail2ban*

### 2.4. Modify Conditions

`/etc/fail2ban/jail.local`
If `jail.local` does not exist, copy `jail.conf`. fail2ban gives precedence to the setting values in `jail.local` over those in `jail.conf`.

```conf
[DEFAULT]

ignoreip = 1.2.3.5 1.2.3.4 # Set whitelist IP addresses

...

[sshd]
enabled = true
port = ssh # The port number that SSH service is running on
filter = sshd # The name of the filter to use for SSH service monitoring

# Note: auth.log only saves one day of logs and compresses old logs to .gz files
logpath = /var/log/auth.log 

# If an IP fails 3 times within 6000 seconds, it will be banned for 36000 seconds
maxretry = 3
findtime = 6000 
bantime = 36000 # -1 is forever
```

**You must test a configuration file and  fail2ban and  after modifying `jail.local`**
```bash
fail2ban-client -t
sudo systemctl restart fail2ban
```

### 2.5. Ban in manual
```
sudo fail2ban-client set sshd banip 1.2.3.4
```

### 2.6. Unban in manual
```
sudo fail2ban-client set sshd unbanip 1.2.3.4
```
