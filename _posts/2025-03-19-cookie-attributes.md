<div markdown="1">
- Because the browser is smart, it automatically manages and stores cookies.
- When saving cookies in your browser, you can use the `Set-Cookie` response header to save cookies in your browser and control properties.

## 1. Overview

| **Attribute** | **Description** | **Example** |
|-|-|
| **`Name=Value`** | Defines the name and value of the cookie | `session_id=abc123` |
| **`Expires` / `Max-Age`** | Specifies when the cookie should expire | `Expires=Wed, 19 Jun 2025 12:00:00 GMT` |
| **`Domain`** | Specifies which domain can access the cookie | `Domain=.example.com` |
| **`Path`** | Restricts the cookie to a specific URL path | `Path=/account/` |
| **`Secure`** | Ensures the cookie is sent only over HTTPS | `Secure` |
| **`HttpOnly`** | Prevents JavaScript from accessing the cookie | `HttpOnly` |
| **`SameSite`** | Controls how cookies are sent with cross-site requests | `SameSite=Strict` |


| **Attribute** | **Default Behavior (If Not Set)** | **When Explicitly Set** |
|--------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Expires** | Session cookie (deleted when browser closes) | Persistent until a specific date |
| **Domain** | Only available on the current domain | Accessible on subdomains |
| **Path** | Current path and subdirectories | Limited to a specific path |
| **Secure** | Sent over HTTP & HTTPS (security risk) | Sent only over HTTPS (prevents MITM attacks) |
| **HttpOnly** | JavaScript can access (`document.cookie`) | JavaScript cannot access (prevents XSS) |
| **SameSite** | `Lax` (CSRF protection enabled) | `Strict` (stronger CSRF protection) or `None` (allows all requests) |

üöÄ **Secure Cookie Example:**
```http
Set-Cookie: session_id=xyz123; Secure; HttpOnly; SameSite=Strict; Expires=Wed, 19 Jun 2025 12:00:00 GMT
```
üìå This setup ensures **CSRF/XSS protection, HTTPS security, and automatic session expiration.**  

---

## 2. `Name=Value` (Cookie Name and Value)**
Every cookie consists of a **name-value pair** which stores data in the browser.

```http
Set-Cookie: session_id=xyz123
```
‚úÖ Creates a cookie named `session_id` with a value of `xyz123`.

---

## 3. `Expires` / `Max-Age` (Cookie Expiration Time)

### 3.1. `Expires`
- Specifies a **fixed expiration date and time** in GMT/UTC format.
- Once the expiration date is reached, the browser automatically deletes the cookie.

```http
Set-Cookie: session_id=xyz123; Expires=Wed, 19 Jun 2025 12:00:00 GMT
```
‚úÖ This cookie **expires on June 19, 2025, at 12:00 GMT**.

---

### 3.2. `Max-Age`
- Specifies the cookie's **lifespan in seconds** from the time it is set.
- `Max-Age=0` means the cookie expires **immediately**.

```http
Set-Cookie: session_id=xyz123; Max-Age=3600
```
‚úÖ The cookie lasts **for 1 hour (3,600 seconds)** before expiring.

---

### 3.3. Difference Between `Expires` and `Max-Age`
- `Expires` sets an **absolute expiration date**.
- `Max-Age` sets a **relative expiration time** (in seconds).
- If both are present, **`Max-Age` takes precedence**.

---

### 3.4. If Not set
- The browser stores it until when the current session ends

---

## 4. `Domain` (Specifies Where the Cookie is Accessible)**

###  4.1. `Domain` is NOT set
The cookie is **only accessible from the domain that set it.

```http
Set-Cookie: auth_token=xyz123
```
‚úÖ The cookie is available **only on `example.com`**.  
‚ùå It is **not accessible from `sub.example.com`**.

---

### 4.2. `Domain` is set
The cookie **can be accessed by the specified domain and all its 

```http
Set-Cookie: auth_token=xyz123; Domain=.example.com
```
‚úÖ The cookie is **available on `example.com`, `sub.example.com`, `blog.example.com`, etc.**

---

## 5. `Path` (Restricting Cookie Usage to Specific Paths)
### 5.1. `Path` is NOT set
The cookie is **available for the directory where it was set and its subdirectories**.

---

### 5.2. `Path` is set

The cookie is **restricted to that specific path**.

```http
Set-Cookie: user_token=abc123; Path=/account/
```
‚úÖ The cookie is available **only for `/account/` and its subdirectories**.  
‚ùå It will **not be sent with requests to `/home/` or `/profile/`**.

---

## 6. `Secure` (Restricting Cookies to HTTPS Only)
### 6.1. `Secure` is NOT set
The cookie is sent over **both HTTP and HTTPS**

---

### 6.2. `Secure` is set
The cookie is sent **ONLY over HTTPS**, preventing **man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks**.

```http
Set-Cookie: session_id=xyz123; Secure
```
‚úÖ The cookie **is only transmitted over HTTPS**.  
‚ùå **It is not sent over HTTP** (better security).

---

## 7. `HttpOnly` (Preventing JavaScript Access to Cookies)

### 7.1. `HttpOnly` is Not set
JavaScript can **read and modify** the cookie using `document.cookie` (security risk!).

---

### 7.2. `HttpOnly` is set
JavaScript **cannot access the cookie** (prevents XSS attacks).
```http
Set-Cookie: session_id=xyz123; HttpOnly
```
‚úÖ Now, **JavaScript cannot access `session_id`**, but the browser will still send it in HTTP requests.

---

### 7.3. Why is `HttpOnly` important?
- Prevents **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks** where malicious scripts steal cookies.
- Ensures cookies **can only be accessed by the server**.

---

## 8. `SameSite` (Preventing CSRF Attacks)
- `SameSite` controls **whether cookies are sent with cross-site requests**.
- Cookies will automatically be included in the request if they are of the same origin.

| **SameSite Value** | **Behavior** |
|------------------|--------------------------------|
| **`Strict`** | Cookie is **only sent for same-site requests** (most secure). |
| **`Lax`** | Cookie is **sent when users click a link but not with other cross-site requests**. (Default) |
| **`None`** | Cookie is **sent with all requests, even from other sites** (must be `Secure`). |

---

### 8.1. (`Lax`, `SameSite` is Not set):
```http
Set-Cookie: session_id=xyz123; SameSite=Lax
```
‚úÖ **Cross-site automatic requests (like `fetch`,`<img>`,`<iframe>`,`XMLHttpRequest`) will not include the cookie**, preventing CSRF attacks.  
‚úÖ **If a user clicks a link(`<a hef>`), the cookie will be sent**.

---

### 8.2. (`Strict`, maximum security):
```http
Set-Cookie: session_id=xyz123; SameSite=Strict
```
‚úÖ **The cookie is never sent with cross-site requests**, even if the user clicks a link.

---

### 8.3. (`None`, allows all requests):
```http
Set-Cookie: session_id=xyz123; SameSite=None; Secure
```
‚úÖ The cookie **is sent with all requests**, but `Secure` is **required** (must be HTTPS).

---

## 9. Conclusion
-  **If cookie attributes are not explicitly set, browsers use default values that may not be secure.**  
- **For sensitive cookies (e.g., login sessions), always use `Secure`, `HttpOnly`, and `SameSite`.**  
- **To prevent session expiration, set `Expires` or `Max-Age`.**  
- **To allow cookies on subdomains, specify `Domain`.**
