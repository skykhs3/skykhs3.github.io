I worked as a backend developer for the **Club Vegas Studio server team**<br/>
**Role** : Backend Developer, Club Vegas Server Team<br/>
**Work Period** : February 26, 2024 - August 25, 2024<br/>

## 2. Key Tasks
As a member of the Club Vegas Studio server team, my tasks included:
- Developing the game backend API server using TypeScript (**Express.js**)
- Developing an in-house admin website using **React**
- Developing a game item purchase and payment website using **Next.js** and **NestJS**
- Building a backend server to support third-party payments by integrating with third-party payment providers' webhooks
- Operating the system with **AWS and Kubernetes (EKS)**
- Implementing CI/CD pipelines using **GitHub Actions**

## 3. Key Projects
I independently undertook the development work for the following projects:

### Implementing Challenge Missions
I implemented the logic for rewarding items to users who achieve certain milestones or frequencies on [third-party payment sites](https://store.clubvegasslots.com/){:target="_blank"} to facilitate third-party payments. I also implemented a system to send analytic data to the Data Analysis team to measure the revenue impact of these challenge missions and improved an in-house admin website that can manage milestones or frequencies tailored to each player. **My task is to improve the company's revenue.**

### Website Login Page Renewal
I developed a [payment website login page](https://playclubvegas.com/) that allows users to log in by clicking a button, which automatically launches the game app and logs them in. **This task improved the login experience, allowing users to log in more easily.**

### Refactoring Event Rewards Logic
I refactored the code related to event rewards and developed both the frontend and backend code for the in-house admin website. **This enhancement enabled game administrators to dynamically and easily configure event reward values.**

### Building a Backend Server to Support Third-Party Payments and New Game Items
I developed the logic for selling and configuring new game items by integrating with [third-party payment webhooks and APIs](https://developers.appcharge.com/reference/getting-started-with-appcharge-api){:target="_blank"}. **This integration enabled game administrators, via the in-house admin website, to dynamically configure and manage new game items for sale.**

### DevOps
I participated in AWS workshops and the AWS Summit, where I learned about the latest trends in cloud computing. **While managing Club Vegas Studioâ€™s infrastructure, I also gained experience in using Terraform and Kubernetes(EKS).**
